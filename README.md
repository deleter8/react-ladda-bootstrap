# react-ladda-bootstrap-npm

[ladda-bootstrap](http://msurguy.github.io/ladda-bootstrap/) components built with [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/)

Was having issues getting react-ladda working seamlessly with react-bootstrap. This is based on react-ladda and uses ladda-bootstrap.

Note: Still a heavy work in progress.
